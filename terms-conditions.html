                            <p><strong>5. Dispute Resolution</strong><br>
                                </p><ul>
                                    <p>A. Governing Law. Use of this Website, any purchases made through this Website, and any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating in any way to your use of this Website or purchases through this Website and/or your Account, shall be governed by the laws of your home state of residence without respect to its choice (or conflict) of laws rules.</p>
                                    <p>B. Class Action Waiver. Both you and we waive the right to bring any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating in any way to your use of this Website, your membership in or purchases from the Website and/or your Account, or products purchased through this Website as a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action regarding any such claim brought my anyone else. (This waiver, and the similar waiver specified for arbitration proceedings, are generally referred to herein as “the class action waiver.”)</p>
                                    <p>C. Forum Selection/Jurisdiction. Jurisdiction and venue for any dispute shall be in Las Vegas, Nevada. Each party submits to personal jurisdiction and venue in that forum for any and all purposes.</p>
                                    <p>D. Agreement to Pre-Arbitration Notification. These Terms of Service provide for final, binding arbitration of all disputed claims (discussed immediately below). We and you agree, however, that it would be advantageous to discuss and hopefully resolve any disputes before arbitration proceedings or any other proceedings authorized herein are initiated. In the event of a dispute, the claimant whether you or us shall send a letter to the other side briefly summarizing the claim and the request for relief. If we are the claimant, the letter shall be sent, via email, to the email account listed in your Account. If you are the claimant, the letter shall be sent to [add address]. If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (180) days after the letter is sent, the claimant may proceed to initiate arbitration proceedings or any other proceedings authorized herein.</p>
                                    <p>E. Agreement to Arbitrate Claims. Except to the limited extent noted below, use of this Website, any purchases made through this Website, and any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating in any way to your use of this Website or purchases through this Website and/or your Account shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration between you and us. The arbitration shall take place in Las Vegas, Nevada in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedures of the American Arbitration Association. Unless either party or the arbitrator requests a hearing, the parties will submit their arguments and evidence to the arbitrator in writing. The arbitrator will make an award based only on the documents. This is called a Desk Arbitration. If any party makes a written request for a hearing within ten (10) days after the American Arbitration Association acknowledges receipt of a claimant's demand for arbitration (or the arbitrator requests a hearing), the parties shall participate in a telephone hearing. In no event shall the parties be required to travel to Las Vegas, Nevada to participate in the arbitration. If you decide to commence arbitration, the provider will require to you to pay a filing fee, for which you will be reimbursed any excess amounts. If the arbitrator ultimately rules in your favor, we will also reimburse you for the base filing fee. This arbitration agreement is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and is enforceable pursuant to its terms on a self-executing basis. Either party may seek enforcement of this provision in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall determine any and all challenges to the arbitrability of a claim. The arbitral award shall be judicially enforceable. Any court of competent jurisdiction may, and upon request shall, enter judgment on the arbitral award. Either party may seek confirmation (judgment on the award) and/or enforcement in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any provision in the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedures to the contrary, and with the exception of Desk Arbitrations, the Federal Rules of Evidence shall govern the admissibility of evidence in any arbitral proceeding. Both you and we waive the right to bring any claim covered by this dispute resolution provision as a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action, or to participate in a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action regarding any claim covered by this dispute resolution provision brought by anyone else. Notwithstanding any provision in the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedures to the contrary, the arbitrator shall not have the authority or any jurisdiction to hear the arbitration as a class, consolidated, representative, or private attorney general action or to consolidate, join, or otherwise combine the claims of different persons into one proceeding. If a proposed class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action arbitration is initiated notwithstanding the above prohibition and it is finally determined by the arbitrator (or a court of competent jurisdiction) that the waiver specified herein is not enforceable, then the arbitration proceedings shall be bifurcated as follows and notwithstanding any provision in the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedures to the contrary: 1. The issue of arbitrability shall be determined by the Arbitrator pursuant to the applicable rules and substantive law. 2. Assuming the Arbitrator concludes that the arbitration may proceed, said arbitration shall be stayed, and the issue of whether to certify any alleged or putative class for a class action (or other representative) proceeding shall be presented to and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall not have authority or jurisdiction to decide class certification (or any similar representative action) issues. The decision to certify or not certify a class action (or to otherwise permit the action to proceed on a representative basis) shall be appealable in the judicial proceedings consistent with the rules and law governing the appeals of interlocutory decisions or class certification (or similar) rulings specifically, if appropriate. 3. Once any issues regarding class certification (and/or similar representative requirements) have been finally decided by the court, the arbitrator will have authority to decide the substantive claims on an individual or a class (or other representative) basis, as may be determined and directed by the court.</p>
                                    <p>F. Appeal Rights. The arbitrator(s) shall not have the power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning, make clearly erroneous factual findings, or abuse his or her discretion, and the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error.</p>
                                    <p>G. Opting out of Dispute Resolution and Class Action Waiver. You may elect to opt out (exclude yourself) from the final, binding arbitration procedure and the class action waiver specified in these Terms of Service by doing the following: within fifteen (15) days of setting up your Account, you must send a letter to 66 W Flagler Street STE 900, Miami, FL 33130 addressed specifically to us that specifies (1) your name, (2) your account number or account member name, (3) your mailing address, and (4) your request to be excluded from the final, binding arbitration procedure and class action waiver specified in these Terms of Service. All other Terms shall continue to apply to your Account, including the requirement to participate in pre-dispute mediation. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary, we agree that, if we make any future change to the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions (other than a change to our address), you may reject any such change by sending a letter to us within fifteen (15) days of the change to the address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision. Your letter must be postmarked by the applicable fifteen (15) day deadline to be effective. You are not required to send the letter by confirmed mail or return receipt requested, but it is recommended that you do so. Your request to be excluded will only be effective and enforceable if you can prove that the request was postmarked within the applicable fifteen (15) day deadline.</p>
                                </ul>
                            <p></p>
